            <p>Your average telecommunication engineering
                undergraduate student at Bandung Institute of Technology that fail to enroll informatics. Nevertheless

                and applying concepts like wireless communication, digital signal processing, 
                IoT, and network security.

            <h3>Undergraduate Telecommunication <span>Student</span></h3>
            <p>
                I am currently a third-year Telecommunication Engineering student at Institut Teknologi Bandung. 
                I have developed a broad interest in various fields within telecommunication, which makes me 
                feel like "all-rounder." Initially, my background was more focused on informatics, which made
                 it challenging to grasp some of the concepts in telecommunication. However, I had the opportunity 
                 to meet inspiring and supportive people who motivated me to persevere.<br><br>

                Now, I am fully focused on completing my degree and am still actively involved in competitive programming, 
                which is closely related to my informatics interests. My team and I had the incredible opportunity to compete in the 
                ICPC Asia-Jakarta Regional Competition in both 2023 and 2024. These experiences reinforced my belief that, no matter where 
                I study, my passion remains unshaken.<br><br>

                One of the most influential parts of my university journey has been my involvement in 
                the IMT "Signum" ITB organization, where I met incredible people who contributed significantly to 
                my personal growth. Being part of this group has continuously pushed me to improve.<br><br>

                If I were to highlight an interesting experience during my studies, it would be the IMT inauguration ceremony, 
                as well as maintaining a 100% attendance record in all my courses during the 4th semester—both of which were key 
                milestones for me.
